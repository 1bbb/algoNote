# LeetCode 1101 - 1150

### 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends

In a social group, there are `N` people, with unique integer ids from `0` to `N-1`. We have a list of `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B]` contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A. Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

Example:

```
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], N = 6
Output: 20190301
```

Solution: union and find，一定要背

```cpp
vector<int> parent;

int earliestAcq(vector<vector<int>>& logs, int N) {
    sort(logs.begin(), logs.end(), [](auto & v1, auto & v2) {return v1[0] < v2[0];});
    parent.resize(N);
    iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
    for (const auto& log : logs) {
       if (uni(log[1], log[2])) --N;
       if (N == 1) return log[0];
    }
    return -1;
}

bool uni(int i, int j) {
    int pi = find(i), pj = find(j);
    parent[pj] = pi;
    return pi != pj;
}

int find(int i) {
    if (parent[i] == i) return i;
    return parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
}
```

### 1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value

Given a matrix of integers `A` with R rows and C columns, find the **maximum** score of a path starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[R-1,C-1]`. The *score* of a path is the **minimum** value in that path.

Example:

```
Input: [
    [5,4,5],
    [1,2,6],
    [7,4,6]
]
Output: 4 (5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6)
```

Solution: 用priority queue实现Dijkstra，一定要背

```cpp
struct Vertex {
    int i;
    int j;
    int val;
    friend bool operator < (const Vertex& lhs, const Vertex& rhs) { return lhs.val < rhs.val;}
};

int maximumMinimumPath(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
    const vector<pair<int, int>> dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {1, 0}};
    const int n = A.size(), m = A[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> minval(n, vector<int>(m, -1));
    priority_queue<Vertex> q;
    q.push({0, 0, A[0][0]});
    while (!q.empty()) {
        const auto [i, j, val] = q.top(); q.pop();         
        for (auto [dx, dy] : dirs) {
            int x = i + dx, y = j + dy;
            if (x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= m || minval[x][y] != -1) continue;
            minval[x][y] = min(val, A[x][y]);
            if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1) return minval[x][y];
            q.push({ x, y, minval[x][y] });
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### 1103. Distribute Candies to People

We distribute some number of `candies`, to a row of **n = num_people** people in the following way:

We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give `n` candies to the last person.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving `n + 1` candies to the first person, `n + 2` candies to the second person, and so on until we give `2 * n` candies to the last person.

This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).

Return an array (of length `num_people` and sum `candies`) that represents the final distribution of candies

Example:

```
Input: candies = 7, num_people = 4
Output: [1,2,3,1]
```

Solution: brute force，也可以预先求和加速

```cpp
vector<int> distributeCandies(int candies, int n) {
    vector<int> res(n);
    for (int i = 0; candies > 0; ++i) {
        res[i % n] += min(candies, i + 1);
        candies -= i + 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```

### 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree

In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

![img](../.gitbook/assets3/tree.png)

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.

Example:

```
Input: label = 14
Output: [1,3,4,14]
```

Solution: 数学

```cpp
vector<int> pathInZigZagTree(int label) {
    int level = 0;
    while (1 << level <= label) ++level;
    vector<int> res(level);
    for(; label >= 1; label /= 2, --level) {
        res[level - 1] = label;
        label = (1 << level) - 1 - label + (1 << (level - 1));
    }
    return res;
}
```

### 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves

We have a sequence of `books`: the `i`-th book has thickness `books[i][0]` and height `books[i][1]`. We want to place these books **in order** onto bookcase shelves that have total width `shelf_width`.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is `<= shelf_width`), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

Example:

![img](../.gitbook/assets3/shelves.png)

```
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6 (The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.)
```

Solution: dp，dp[i]为前i本书能够到达的最小高度。对于第i+1本书，有两种选择 (1) 如自己单独一层，则状态转移为 `dp[i+1] = dp[i] + h[i+1]` (2) 如果和前面的书放在一起，则状态转移方程式 `dp[i+1] = min(dp[j] + max[h[j+1] ~ h[i+1]))`, 其中需要满足 `sum(w[j+1] ~ w[i+1]) <= shelf_width`，含义是前j本书组成若干层，第j+1到第i+1本书组成一层。 两种选择取最小值。一定要背

```cpp
int minHeightShelves(vector<vector<int>>& books, int shelf_width) {
    vector<int> dp(books.size() + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= books.size(); ++i){
        vector<int> & b = books[i-1];
        int w = b[0], h = b[1];
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + h;
        for(int j = i - 1; j > 0; --j){
            w += books[j-1][0];
            h = max(h, books[j-1][1]);
            if (w > shelf_width) break;
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + h);
        }
    }
    return dp.back();
}
```

### 1108. Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP `address`, return a defanged version of that IP address. A *defanged IP address* replaces every period `"."` with `"[.]"`.

Example:

```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

Solution: brute force

```cpp
string defangIPaddr(string address) {
    string ret;
    for (const char & c: address) {
        if (c == '.') ret += "[.]";
        else ret += c;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

### 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings

There are `n` flights, and they are labeled from `1` to `n`. We have a list of flight bookings.  The `i`-th booking `bookings[i] = [i, j, k]` means that we booked `k` seats from flights labeled `i` to `j` inclusive. Return an array `answer` of length `n`, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

Example:

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
```

Solution: 遍历一遍，按照range加seats会超时；正确做法是统计每个时间戳的加减座椅个数，一定要背

```cpp
vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
    vector<int> ret, operations(n + 1, 0);
    for (vector<int> & booking: bookings) {
        int & seats = booking[2];
        operations[booking[0] - 1] += seats;
        operations[booking[1]] -= seats;
    }
    int cur = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cur += operations[i];
        ret.push_back(cur);
    }
    return ret;
}
```

### 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value. After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees). Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
     1
   /   \
  2     3
 / \   / \
4   5 6   7
to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

Solution: 赋值递归，外加用个hashset加速寻值，一定要背

```cpp
TreeNode* helper (TreeNode* root, unordered_set<int> & dict, vector<TreeNode*> & forest) {
    if (!root) return root;
    root->left = helper(root->left, dict, forest);
    root->right = helper(root->right, dict, forest);
    if (dict.count(root->val)) {
        if (root->left) forest.push_back(root->left);
        if (root->right) forest.push_back(root->right);
        root = NULL;
    }
    return root;
}

vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
    vector<TreeNode*> forest;
    unordered_set<int> dict(to_delete.begin(), to_delete.end());
    root = helper(root, dict, forest);
    if (root) forest.push_back(root);
    return forest;
}
```

### 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings

A string is a *valid parentheses string* (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of `"("`and `")"` characters only, and:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are VPS's, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a VPS.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, such that `A`and `B` are VPS's (and `A.length + B.length = seq.length`). Now choose **any** such `A` and `B` such that `max(depth(A), depth(B))` is the minimum possible value.

Return an `answer` array (of length `seq.length`) that encodes such a choice of `A`and `B`:  `answer[i] = 0` if `seq[i]` is part of `A`, else `answer[i] = 1`.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

Example:

```
Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]
```

Solution: 按照奇偶数层分开即可

```cpp
vector<int> maxDepthAfterSplit(string seq) {
    vector<int> encoding;
    int depth = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < seq.length(); ++i) {
        if (seq[i] == '(') {
            ++depth;
            encoding.push_back(depth % 2);
        } else {
            encoding.push_back(depth % 2);
            --depth;
        }
    }
    return encoding;
}
```
